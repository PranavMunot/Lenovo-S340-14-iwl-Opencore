# Lenovo-S340-14-iwl-Opencore
Opencore Lenovo S340-iwl (i5-8265u, 8GB ram, 1TB HDD, Catalina)

# What Works:
1. THE OS(Mac-Os Catalina)
2. Audio
3. Wifi & Bluetooth(wifi doesn't work at it's full potential)
4. Keyboard & Trackpad with gestures

# What Don't Works:
1. HDMI
2. Headphones when connected, you will get the rhythm but no vocals :( (ALT. you could use bluetooh earphones/headphone which works fine)
3. No backlight working but added SSDT-PNLF-CFL so hope it works.
